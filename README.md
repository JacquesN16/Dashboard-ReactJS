# React Web Dashboard

React Web Dashboard is my personal project to learn using react router and some UI frameworks. I have created the website from a design on [UI Design Daily](https://www.uidesigndaily.com/posts/studio-app-dashboard-ui-design-day-1333)

## Installation

Clone the project from [myGithub](https://github.com/JacquesN16/Dashboard-ReactJS.git)
Once the project is cloned use

```bash
yarn add
```

to install all the dependencies

## Usage
to start the localhost with 
```javascript
yarn start
```
then you can find the project at

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

## Frameworks and tools
As mentioned above for this particular project I have used
- For the design
1. [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for all the icons 
2. [Rechart](https://recharts.org) for the charts

- For others  
1. [React router dom](https://reactrouter.com/) for navigation between pages

the completed installation is

```
yarn add @material-ui/core react-router-dom recharts
```
